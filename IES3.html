  <p class="heading">→ After 10th — The Pressure ←</p>

  <p>
    After 10th grade, the real pressure begins — the pressure of deciding the future, choosing the right stream, and meeting everyone’s expectations. Extra subjects and some irrelevant practicals only add more confusion. Competitive exams like JEE and NEET have become races where everyone is chasing ranks and marks. Coaching institutes demand lakhs of rupees, keep changing their strategies every year, and students get lost in the chaos. For many parents, only studies matter — cricket, football, music, or art are seen as distractions. If a child tries to speak up, they’re told they’re being disrespectful. All of this together creates a mindset where some students, under unbearable pressure, may end up taking wrong steps. We must understand that marks or exams do not define life — every child has a unique talent and a dream.

  <p class="kalam">
    r. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam once said that our education system should encourage creativity, innovation, and practical learning. He believed that students should be given the freedom to explore their interests and find joy in learning — not fear in failure. His vision reminds us that true education should build minds, not just measure marks.
